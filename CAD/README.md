# CAD files

The DWFX file is best viewed with the online viewer from Autodesk (viewer.autodesk.com). 

The "3D printe parts" folder contains the .STL files for all printed parts used in cScope. These files can be uplaoded and used directly for 3d printing. We have used the company 3dsystems.com and the following process, materials and finish: Process: Stereolithography (SLA), Material: High-Res ABS-Like Black (either Accura SL 7820, or Renshape 7820 / VisiJet SL Black), Standard Finish. When asked for units during order process, enter "mm". 

The "machineshop" folder contains the drawings for the few parts that require machining.
