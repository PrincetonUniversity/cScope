Data Processing Software

Included in this directory are MATLAB scripts for processing the data files generated by cScope.  In order to run these scripts you will need to have a folder containing the .avi files and a timestamp.dat file that are produced by the miniscope camera acquisition system.  We assume that you will also have a data file produced by the Bcontrol software available here: http://brodywiki.princeton.edu/bcontrol/index.php/Main_Page

In order to run the motion correction stage in the preprocessing pipeline you will also need to download NoRMCorre:
https://github.com/simonsfoundation/NoRMCorre

Proceed in the following order:
1) cScope_preprocessing (~ 1 hour)
2) Hemodynamic_correction or Hemodynamic_correction_version2 (~ 12 hours)
3) Widefield_analysis (< 1 hour)

Included in parentheses are the approximate runtimes for processing a ~150,000 frame movie on a MacBookPro with a 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 memory.
