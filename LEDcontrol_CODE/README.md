# LEDs control

The Arduino folder contains the two arduino codes, DELAY and GATE, loaded respectively on Arduino 1 and Arduino 2 (see manuscript supplemental figure). 
For each arduino, two versions of the code are written for different camera speeds (frame rate of 30Hz and 60Hz).

The Matlab folder contains the code run on the "LED control" computer.
